Colombo client app


# Compile and Run
To compile and run the Colombo Flutter client application, ensure you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. Follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the client service directory:
   ```bash
   cd services/client
   ```
2. Get the dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   This will launch the application on the connected device or emulator.

# Protocol Buffers
The client application relies on Protocol Buffers for data serialization.
To generate the necessary files read the instructions in `/proto/README.md`.
